# Vehicle-Auction-Price-Analysis
According to McKinseyâ€™s report, the used car market is more than twice the size of the new car market in the US. So, in order to better serve customers in the used car market, I want to investigate what features a customer values most.

So using the car auction price dataset, I try to figure out what kind of used cars customers are willing to pay for a lot of money, i.e., what is the common characteristic of used cars sold at low, medium, and high prices; and develop a recommendation engine based on customers' demands.
