# Vehicle-Auction-Price-Analysis
According to McKinseyâ€™s report, the used-car market is more than twice size of the new car market in US. So, in order to better serve customers in used-car market, we want to investigate what features that a customer value most.
So using the car auction price dataset, I try to figure out what kind of used-cars that customers are willing to pay for a lot of money, i.e., what is the common characteristic of used-cars sold in low, medium, and high price.
